# Robo Reminder
This project - a continuation of HW 10 AWS Unit 13 - its to support the process of a new accounting employee who has daily tasks that she doesn't want to miss on any day. So she has requested this robo-reminder, which she can run towards the end of the day, to make sure she hasn't missed anything. 

The more I think about it, the ongoing utility becomes clear. It's changing in my imagination to more of an ongoing process.

There is always a need to prioritize any free time amongst competing demands. It would be interesting to have a robo-reminder (RR) do that as possible. 

Here's how that would work (maybe a subsequent activity after this project iteration): I would launch the RR when I have a period of time free. It would ask some questions to determine tasks necessary and what the rest of the day looks like, and then it would present a triaged list of tasks for that period. And possibly a b-list for the later period that day as well. 

So I'm thinking to consider both sorts of functionalities.

With this work I'm planning to again utilize the Amazon Lex function for the chat box, the s3 buckets to hold the icons, and the lambda functionality to screen/process the data, adding to the knowledge acquired earlier.

# Technical Notes

Working on this project included setting up an AWS account, setting up an IAM user, and starting to learn about *very* carefully navigating around the enormous universe that is AWS. It amazes me that you can build something, leave it there, go search for a different function, work on that, search for the previous technology, pick that up again and combine those, and then the 3rd thing.. very well crafted. Still overwhelming!

I have the S3 bucket set as totally public, I'll leave everything in place until this assignment is graded or until there starts to be a charge on my account, whichever comes first (or for a week I'm thinking, at the longest). Then I'll go in and delete everything, to not accidentally incur hidden charges suddenly etc..


# Acknowledgements

I would like to first acknowledge the guidance and teaching of our FinTech Boot Camp Instructor, Garth Mortensen, our Student Success Manager, Angelica Baraona; and the whole team behind the curriculum, the logistics, the whole program. I also found the collective Stack Overflow wisdom essential as ever.

This project is for the purpose of my own ongoing learning, it is not a grading instance.
